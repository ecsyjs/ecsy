Events:
- Add 'alive' attribute on components?
- Limit number of components to 1 on events/queries
- What to do with the Group/Mesh/Object3D if several systems wants to share the same entity
- onEvent attribute on a component to be used for example to trigger the paint/teleport action, how to define it
- this.component inside systems
- Component that doesn't need reset() but want to benefit from Pool? => nop
- Declare dependencies on execute:

```javascript
class System {
  init() {
    return {
      queries: {/* ... */},
      dependencies: {
        singleton: [
          ThreeRenderer
        ],
        systems: [
          SystemB,
          SystemC
        ]
      }
    };
  }
}
```
